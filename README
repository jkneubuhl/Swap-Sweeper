Facebook test accounts are needed to work on this application. I've
created an utility application to manage these  accounts:

https://github.com/murphybytes/fb-testuser-tools

After you check out the rails project you'll need
to run 'bundle install'  from the rails project root.  

You'll need to set up localhost to point to www.swapsweep.com

Section 3. Conceptual Framework
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The application is designed to facilitate the barter of goods and 
services between a community of people who have a relationship with 
one another.  There are similar applications out there but this one
differs in two key respects.  Existing web applications rely on
rating systems to communicate satisfaction with the individual 
conducting a transaction. This is to attempt to build some level
of trust with the parties involved.  The Swap application doesn't 
do this because presumibly the parties know one another as 
indicated through Facebook friendship.  Parties desire to stay
in good standing within a Facebook community will facilitate the
integrity as it pertains to behavior in a barter transaction.
